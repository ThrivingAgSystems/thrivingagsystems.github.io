Project Objectives

The project consists of four major objectives and sixteen task teams that are working towards accomplishing those objectives.

Broadly, our project objectives are:

Objective 1. (Years 1–5): Engage closely with stakeholders using a shared discovery framework to envision desired 25-year futures for agricultural systems in urbanized landscapes that are economically sustainable while enhancing ecosystem services.

Objectives 2 and 3. (Years 1–5): Carry out iterative research processes on markets and supply chains for productivity gains (Objective 2) and tools, models, and analyses to improve TFP and NUE

(Objective 3). Examine the recommended technologies, management strategies, and tools for policy-makers coming out of the scenario-building exercises through modelling, experiments, surveys, and demonstrations; bring the results to stakeholders to evaluate; and carry out additional research work based on feedback from stakeholders.

Objective 4. (Years 3-5): Implement education, extension, and evaluation plans to spur adoption.
