## Project Objectives

The project consists of four major objectives and sixteen task teams that are working towards accomplishing those objectives.

Broadly, our project objectives are:

**Objective 1. (Years 1–5):** Engage closely with stakeholders using a shared discovery framework to envision desired 25-year futures for agricultural systems in urbanized landscapes that are economically sustainable while enhancing ecosystem services. Conduct scenario-building exercises with stakeholders to identify how agriculture in urbanized areas may evolve over the next 25 years if current trends continue; how agriculture in urbanized areas would need to evolve to realize the desired futures envisioned by stakeholders; and the technologies, markets, and public policies that could help make the desired futures a reality. Expected outcomes include rapid uptake of the project’s research outputs because they will address identified present-day needs and desired futures. This objective is organized into Tasks 1–4. 

**Objectives 2 and 3. (Years 1–5):** Carry out iterative research processes on markets and supply chains for productivity gains (Objective 2) and tools, models, and analyses to improve TFP and NUE (Objective 3). Examine the recommended technologies, management strategies, and tools for policy-makers coming out of the scenario-building exercises through modelling, experiments, surveys, and demonstrations; bring the results to stakeholders to evaluate; and carry out additional research work based on feedback from stakeholders. Expected outcomes include research outputs that meet user needs and are ready for immediate use rather than requiring considerable adaptation by end users. These objectives are organized into Tasks 5–6 for Objective 2 and Tasks 7–13 for Objective 3.

**Objective 4. (Years 3-5):** Implement education, extension, and evaluation plans to spur adoption. In consultation with stakeholders, develop and offer workshops for policy-makers and businesses along the supply chain for food products; online undergraduate and graduate courses to disseminate project methods and findings; extension programs creating a community of practice on agriculture in urbanized landscapes; and a rigorous external evaluation to provide ongoing feedback to allow the project team to adjust their efforts to better align with project objectives. Expected outcomes include pathways for continued use and further development of the project’s research, extension, and education outputs after the 5-year funding period ends, throughout the 25-year period in the SAS RFA. This objective includes Tasks 14–16.
