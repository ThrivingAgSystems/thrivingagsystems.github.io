Established in 2007, S3 is an ACM SIGGRAPH committee whose mission is to plan, develop, and facilitate activities that bring additional year round value to the student members and emerging professionals of ACM SIGGRAPH through integration with the SIGGRAPH community and career development. This includes individuals who are pursing undergraduate and graduate education, as well as, the those within their first three years after graduation.

S3 also provides continuity and institutional memory for the student volunteer and intern programs at the SIGGRAPH and SIGGRAPH Asia conferences and collaborates with other SIGGRAPH entities on issues that affect student and emerging professionals. S3 has three key programs - resume and reel reviews known as S3R3, mentoring for ACM SIGGRAPH student members known as MentorMe, and a series of webinars.
