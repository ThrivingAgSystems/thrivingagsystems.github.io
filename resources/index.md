## FAQ

### Why does S3 exist?

S3â€™s primary goal is to extend the high-quality services offered by SIGGRAPH Conference programs into year-round services accessible to ACM SIGGRAPH Student members enrolled in programs with a focus on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques. These services include our respected Professional-Student mentoring programs, our Demo Reel, Portfolio and Resume Review Service, our top-quality career services and outreach programs as well as exciting online workshops presented by industry veterans.

### How do I go about obtaining benefits from S3?

Great question! You can obtain benefit from S3 by becoming an ACM SIGGRAPH Student Member, or, if already a member, by signing up for a webinar, or requesting a resume/reel review.

### How do I get involved with the SIGGRAPH Student Volunteer Program?

Apply for the SIGGRAPH Student Volunteer Program [here](https://sv.siggraph.org/).

### I am no longer a student but would like to get involved. How do I do so?

We are always looking for speakers, reviewers, and mentors. If you would like more information, please email us at s3@siggraph.org.
