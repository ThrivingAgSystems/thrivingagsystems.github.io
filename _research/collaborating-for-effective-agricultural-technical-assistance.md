This task aims to understand what agricultural technical assistance practices are most effective at promoting farmersâ€™ adoption of soil and water conservation practices, and to expand their use throughout the Chesapeake Bay region. To achieve this goal, the team is working with technical assistance providers to understand how best to reach out and talk with farmers about conservation practices. Ultimately, the goal is to realize an increase in the number of farmers adopting conservation practices for the amount of effort being put into outreach.

To achieve this goal, the team is pursuing a two-stage research agenda. For the first stage, they interviewed technical assistance providers to understand what they find to be most effective ways of engaging farmers about conservation, and also interviewed and surveyed farmers to understand their experiences working with technical assistance providers. They used results from this exploratory work to design the second stage of the project. For this stage, they are designing a collaborative field experiment to test the effectiveness of different outreach techniques. They will work with technical assistance providers to test different techniques with randomly selected groups of farmers and measure how effective those techniques are at achieving multiple outcomes. Additionally, they are exploring county-level data to see how the implementation of different programs and policies across the watershed are associated with conservation practice adoption and changes in water quality.

Through this work, the team aims to generate an evidence base that will be relevant to practitioners and policy-makers looking to effectively promote the adoption of agricultural conservation practices.
