This research activity seeks to learn what agricultural technical assistance practices are most effective in facilitating farmersâ€™ adoption of soil and water conservation practices, and to foster increased use of such practices throughout the Chesapeake watershed. Towards these ends, the team is working with technical assistance providers to understand the possibilities for how best to reach out and talk to farmers about conservation practices. Their overarching goal is to increase the number of farmers adopting conservation practices for the amount of effort being put into outreach.

The team's research proceeds in two stages. The first stage involved interviews with technical assistance providers to learn what they find to be the most effective ways of engaging farmers about conservation, and also interviewed and surveyed farmers to understand how they think technical assistance could be improved. They used results from the first stage to design the second stage, which is a collaborative field experiment to test the effectiveness of different outreach techniques. Additionally, they are exploring county-level data to see how the implementation of different programs and policies across the watershed are associated with conservation practice adoption and changes in water quality.

Through this work, the team aims to generate an evidence base that will be relevant to practitioners and policy-makers looking to effectively promote the adoption of agricultural conservation practices.
