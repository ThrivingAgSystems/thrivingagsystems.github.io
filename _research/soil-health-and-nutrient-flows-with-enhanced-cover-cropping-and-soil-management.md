Weil and Si are working on the evaluation of soil health and nutrient flow evaluation with a few types of best management practices like enhanced cover cropping and soil management. Their overall goal is to improve the efficiency of use and to reduce the losses of the nutrients, nitrogen and phosphorus, which are important for both crop yields and water pollution by eutrophication. They will do this by monitoring soil properties and sampling water that runoffs of the surface and leaches down to groundwater. They are working on three field sites in total which are at the Central Maryland Research and Education Center Beltsville Facility near Glenn Dale, MD. They have started their research and established the corn and soybean rotations with different cover crop management treatments. In addition, Weil and Si will conduct case studies on several small, diverse farms located in areas of varying degrees of urbanization to investigate how they interact with the local communities and what the nutrient flow and balances are in the systems.

The research at CMREC utilizes a split plot design to compare enhanced cover cropping and minimal cover cropping with three treatments as subplots in corn or soybean cash crop main plots. The three cover crop treatments compared are no cover, rye, and a radish-rye-clover mix. Each of these are managed using traditional and enhanced practices. The traditional practices involve planting cover crops after cash crop harvest in late fall and terminating them in early spring several weeks ahead of cash crop planting. The enhanced cover crop practices involve interseeding and overseeding to establish cover crops earlier and planting green to allow them to grow in spring right up until cash crop planting. Weil and Si have also applied the different rates of nitrogen to cover crop subplots interseeded into corn (rye or radish-clover-rye mixture) in early fall and will collect soil samples and cover crop biomass to determine if adding a small nitrogen boost in fall can increase the nitrogen capture by more than the amount of nitrogen applied.

Weil and Si have been tracking soil moisture and temperature via a network of sensors buried in the soil and connected to dataloggers. They have also been conducting calibrations for these sensors using both topsoil and subsoil material from the sandy and clayey soil sites.

In the field, they have installed 22 mini erosion runoff weirs for collecting surface runoff after major rain events during the fall-winter-spring cover cropping season. They have also installed nearly 100 suction lysimeters to sample soil macropore water at 50 and 90 cm depth to determine nutrient concentrations in water leaching below the root zone. In addition, they have installed 12 shallow piezometer wells in transects running downslope from the cropland into the adjacent forest wetland. An additional 12 deeper wells will be installed in summer when the water table is lower. These wells will be used to periodically sample the upper meter of groundwater year around.

The nutrient concentrations and soil water data will be used to model the hydrology of the sites and provide parameters for regional water and nutrient modeling. The biomass samples of the cover crops have been collected as well and will be analyzed for total N. They are also harvesting and measuring corn and soybean yields. These data will assist in modeling productivity and profitability of the practices.
