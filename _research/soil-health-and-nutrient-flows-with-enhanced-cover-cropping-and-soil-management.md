Weil and Si are working on the evaluation of soil health and nutrient flow evaluation with some type of best management practices like enhanced cover cropping and soil management. There are three field sites in total which are the CMREC Beltsville Facility and Hayden Farm Fields in Glenn Dale, MD. They have started their research and established the corn and soybean rotations with different treatments of cover crop.

These split plots use enhanced cover cropping and minimal cover cropping: no cover, rye, and a radish-rye-clover mix. And during summer and fall we were tracking soil moisture and temperatures, as well as incorporating sensors for different types of soil say topsoil and clay soil on sites.

And in the field, we also installed the erosion runoff wires for a runoff collection from October, after major rain events, crop yield results at that time as well. So we compare the yield and cover crop kind of appeal and overall, we found that there's no significant reduction by cover crop interseeding, but if we take a closer look at the individual treatment. For example, the corn and soybean that the more the better the cover crop it grew, the less the cash crop yields would be less. it's probably because the cover crop

is a nutrient soil system had been used for cover crop, but I still need to be further studied.

And more over we applied the different rates of nitrogen fertilizer to cover crop after harvesting and collect soil samples for further analysis as well. And soil, water and groundwater has been collected weekly by installing the lysimeters and wells.

The biomass samples of cover crop has been collected before the temperature drops down quickly in the previous winter.

So, the main task for the last year were standing up installing instruments and collecting samples. For next year, we will be more focusing on the sample analysis, some lab work. So our goal is to analyze the nutrients such like nitrogen phosphate in the soil and the water samples that will be collected as well as measuring the dry mass

And nitrogen contents of cover crop biomass samples.

Besides, case studies related to the to the urban farms will be proceeds in the following months with the question of how do they interact with communities,

And how do they interact nutrient balances in the system. So when we come to spring and summer another round our soil sample collection will be down so examined soil health like pH, EC, and so on. And the new Chen concentrations
