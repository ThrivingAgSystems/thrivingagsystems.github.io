Kaye, Bradley, Luthard, and Lisenbee are managing a cover crop species selection trial that helps farmers figure out which cover crops help meet their needs. Luthard is doing work on specifically how cover crops affect nutrient cycling across soil texture, so the team can extrapolate what they learn from their local site to other soil sites with other soil textures around the Chesapeake Bay. Most of that work has to do with how they can use cover crops in combination with manure to achieve high yielding corn. If the manure brings a lot of phosphorus and that can be coupled with a lot of nitrogen from legume cover crops, then theoretically we might not need any synthetic fertilizers at all.

Lisenbee is working at the local site and has almost parameterized SWAT. She is also looking to parameterize other adaptive management sites so they can have both modeling and field measurements connected. Lisenbee will be trying to use SWAT to model all of the sites involved in the project to try and help obtain a key data set in order to create a network of adaptive management sites synthesized through modeling.
