Co-PIs Bosch and Shortle and PI Abler are using small and large watershed studies to analyze the potential to increase TFP and NUE and reduce nutrient loadings to water bodies. At the small watershed scale, they are analyzing the practices’ effectiveness to increase TFP and NUE for varying farm types under price and yield uncertainty (Bosch et al., 2018; Qiu et al., 2001; Veith et al., 2008). Farm-level optimization models are being used to assess costs of nutrient loading reductions under varying farm goals (profit maximization, risk minimization). The small watershed analysis will rely on detailed soil-climate models such as SWAT or SWAT+ (see Watershed-Scale Nutrient Management Tools above) to assess nutrient flows and loadings under variable weather at the farm and field levels. Existing farm surveys in the case study Chesapeake Bay region will be used to inform the small watershed model.

The large watershed analysis will focus on the Susquehanna and Potomac watersheds, which comprise over half of the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed. The units of analysis will focus on land-river segments (Kaufman et al., 2014). The goal will be to assess aggregate effects of policies, markets, and technologies on TFP, NUE, and nutrient loadings in these watersheds. Estimated nutrient loads will be based on the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model and will account for spatial heterogeneity using delivery factors specific to each land-river segment and pollutant (Kaufman et al., 2014).

Simulations with both the small and large watershed studies will consider market developments at the national and international levels. Although markets for many agricultural products in urbanized landscapes are local and regional, markets for others are national and international. Achieving regionally sustainable agricultural systems requires considering how these systems are connected to those outside the region (Abler et al., 2000). To accomplish this, the project team will use the SIMPLE-G model of the agricultural economy to study economic connections and feedbacks between local, national, and international scales (Liu et al., 2017; Hertel and Baldos, 2016). SIMPLE-G is a multi-region, partial equilibrium model of gridded cropland use, crop production, consumption, and trade. The model has been applied to study long-run sustainability issues in the global food-water-environment nexus. The model is located on the National Science Foundation’s MyGeoHub ([https://mygeohub.org/](https://mygeohub.org/ "https://mygeohub.org/")), which provides a portal to the model and tools for visualizing simulation results. The model is open source, which will permit modifications of the model for the purposes of this project.

The specific simulations to be conducted would be developed in collaboration with stakeholders. Examples of questions that these models can address are: (1) How would changes in renewable fuels policies or national agricultural conservation policies impact TFP and NUE in the small and large watershed models? (2) How would nutrient trading (Van Houtven et al., 2012), conservation policies including practice and performance incentives and regulations (Ribaudo et al., 2014), spatial targeting (Kaufman et al., 2014), and new technologies (e.g. manure processing) affect TFP and NUE? (3) How sensitive are improvements in TFP, NUE, and nutrient loadings to price and yield variability?
