Thomason is studying nutrient cycling from cover crops to field corn in Virginia. This work will be used to better quantify the rate and timing of nitrogen release from various winter annual cover crops. He is also assessing how cropping system changes that improve soil health affect production and environmental outcomes of field crops.
