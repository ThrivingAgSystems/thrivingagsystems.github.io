Spatial targeting of manure/fertilizer management considering both land suitability and cropping patterns could significantly improve NUE. Manure application in environmentally vulnerable areas such as flood plains, excessively sloped areas, shallow soils, and karst geology areas increases risk of nutrient loss to nearby waterbodies (Saha and Cibin, 2018).

Co-PI Cibin is developing and applying a framework for optimal spatial targeting of nutrients using biophysical characteristics of landscapes and simulation modelling. Land suitability analysis considering biophysical land vulnerabilities is being used for preliminary screening of landscapes. Integrated crop and environmental modelling, which will enable us to simulate the impacts of land use and nutrient management choices, will be carried out using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) (Arnold et al., 1998) and an upgraded version of SWAT known as SWAT+ (Bieger et al., 2017). SWAT is a widely-used, watershed-scale ecohydrological model capable of simulating crop growth and the major components of N and P cycles in landscapes and streams (Neitsch et al., 2005). SWAT updates interactions between components at a daily time scale, and nutrient budgets can be synthesized at various spatial and temporal scales. Cibin has extensive experience with SWAT to evaluate different land uses and management practices under various soil morphologic and hydrologic attributes, and at multiple spatial and temporal scales (e.g. Cibin et al., 2015; Cibin et al., 2018; Fuka et al., 2016; Gramig et al., 2013).
