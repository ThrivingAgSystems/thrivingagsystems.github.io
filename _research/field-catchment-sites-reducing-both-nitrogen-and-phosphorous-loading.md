Toor will be using four field catchment sites in Maryland for his research that will have a corn soil rotation. Most of the sites will also have cover crops. In western Maryland, the team is looking at edge of the field where they can start installing equipment. They are also looking for a field site where the water goes off of the field, so they can put in a flume. Toor is using GIS and digital elevation mapping and remote sensing to identify the points that will work for this research.

On the eastern shore, there is very flat topography and ditches are common. They have draining in some sites and a few sites that have surface runoff. From these sites, the team could estimate leaching and calculate loads of nitrogen. Theyâ€™re also making some progress using isotopes to look at the nitrate sources and the runoff and leached waters. The near-term goal is figuring out what they could do on agricultural lands to reduce both nitrogen and phosphorous loading by 20 percent.
