Consumer studies find that both local and organic attributes are highly valued in the marketplace (Feldmann and Hamm, 2015; Jaenicke and Carlson, 2015). One of our hypotheses is that this value may be higher in areas where farms coexist and come into frequent contact with urban and exurban consumers. If consumers fail to value these attributes, the spatial distribution of agricultural production will be driven only by production and distribution costs, and the prospects for agriculture’s survival against development pressures in urbanized landscapes will generally be dim. However, we already observe large and increasing amounts of value-added local and organic products in the marketplace.

Co-PIs Jaenicke and Liu will undertake consumer studies of demand for local and organic products to assess the future growth potential. Project personnel will use micro-level food-purchase data via institutional access and current research collaborations. These micro-level data contain detailed information on more than 60,000 U.S. households and their purchased products. Organic is a product attribute identified in the data; but, a product’s “localness” is generally not identified. Using the micro-level data to study local products, we will identify a wide number of local products already sold in various regions of the U.S. and add appropriate product identifiers to the database. Once the enhanced database is built, project personnel will estimate consumer demands for these products and their accompanying price premiums.
