Klaiber, Wrenn, Shortle, and Hua are focusing their research on a land conversion model and how one land use type is converting to another. They are using data to discover what land is undeveloped and then using that to figure out when that undeveloped land becomes developed. They are aiming to gain a richer characterization of conversions from one land use type to another.

This research team is also gathering information on prices and have assembled a nationwide data set. In the Chesapeake Bay region, there are several million housing transactions, farm transactions, and vacant land transactions. The team is thinking about how to create measures of both the value of locations for urban development, as well as the value of farmland that's being transacted. This involves taking millions of housing transactions and farm transactions and trying to estimate the price of land in these different land use types in different regions. The aim is to use these prices as key determinants of why land might change from one type to another.

Klaiber, Wrenn, Shortle, and Hua have some preliminary analysis of two questions which they hope to build further on. The first is to look at the data at some spatial aggregate and determine what's happening to land in that region. Do prices matter? Do things like the provision of urban services or maybe environmental policies still influence the decision making of how land converts from one type to another?

The second piece focuses on policies and looking at the TMDL. Is TMDL a constraint or an added cost to agriculture? Is there a difference in the conversion into and out of agriculture inside the TMDL versus outside before and after the policy was enacted? The team has started to look around the border of this region of where the TMDL applies. Both inside and just outside this region to see whether or not they can see changes in the land conversion rates, how fast land is leaving agriculture, or coming into agriculture in these different regions.
