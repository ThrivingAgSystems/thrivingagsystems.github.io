Co-PIs Klaiber, Wrenn, and Shortle are developing agent-based models of individual farmer-landowner decision-making to understand changes in behavior that impact both TFP and NUE across spatial scales (Irwin and Wrenn, 2014; Nguyen et al., 2013). The spatial agro-environmental choices farmers make are expected to depend critically on the scale of operation and the spatial pattern of landholdings by individual landowners, opportunities to sell farmland to developers, and consumer demands for locally grown foods. These individual farm decisions aggregate across space to drive watershed-level economic and environmental outcomes. Our agent-based models of producer behavior will build on the joint multiple output representation of production (Chambers and Just, 1989) to model the amount of farmland, land allocation on farms, inputs, yields, and intensity outcomes (Fezzi and Bateman, 2011).

To estimate these agent-based models, we are drawing on micro-level data of individual landowner decisions collected through existing data and surveys of farmers. We expect tradeoffs or complementarities between economic and environmental outcomes may emerge across different spatial scales ranging from local levels to more aggregate levels extending to watershed scales. At the local level, these outcomes are likely to be driven by spatial features and characteristics of individual farmland parcels including soil fertility, proximity to developed parcels of land, adoption of best management practices, proximity to environmentally sensitive areas such as waterways, and land use regulations. At larger watershed scales, outcomes will depend on independent actions taken by individual agents, consumer demands for locally grown products in the watershed, and environmental policies.

The specific simulations to be conducted would be developed in collaboration with stakeholders. Among the questions that the agent-based models will address are: (1) How does on-farm allocation of land, including BMP adoption, impact TFP for individual landowners? (2) What are the production and environmental tradeoffs or complementarities that arise from differing patterns of land use? (3) How do consumer demands and environmental policies alter local land use decisions? (4) Does uncoordinated local activity lead to inefficiencies in input allocation that could be reduced to enhance TFP and improve environmental outcomes?
