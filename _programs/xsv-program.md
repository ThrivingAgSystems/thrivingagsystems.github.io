Are you no longer qualified to be a SIGGRAPH Student Volunteer? Want to become more involved with ACM SIGGRAPH and the computer graphics community? Thinking about someday applying to be on an ACM SIGGRAPH committee or SIGGRAPH conference subcommittee? If you answered “Yes!” to these questions, then the XSV Program is for YOU! This program is a unique opportunity to get a behind-the-scenes perspective on everything involved with an ACM SIGGRAPH Executive Committee or a specific SIGGRAPH Conference program.

As an XSV, you will either take on a specific role on an ACM SIGGRAPH Executive or SIGGRAPH Conference Committee or contribute to a specific project. You will be mentored by an ACM SIGGRAPH or SIGGRAPH Conference Committee member and have the opportunity to build your SIGGRAPH network by meeting and learning from the professionals, creators, educators, and visionaries who make SIGGRAPH possible. Individuals who demonstrate leadership and a passion for volunteering for SIGGRAPH are encouraged to apply!

This experience is available to those who are no longer eligible to serve as a SIGGRAPH Conference Student Volunteer or Team Leader and are at least 18 years old by the time of the conference. High school, undergraduate, or graduate students enrolled full time for at least one semester during the current academic year are NOT eligible. Applicants must have attended the SIGGRAPH Conference at least once in the last 3 years.

Don’t miss out on the opportunity to expand your knowledge of what goes into putting this awesome conference together each year and get involved with the SIGGRAPH community!
