<p>S3R3 is the S3 Resume and Reel Review program where ACM Student Members and Student Chapters’
  members have their resume or reel reviewed by industry professionals. This is conducted either virtually
  or in-person at the SIGGRAPH and SIGGRAPH Asia Conferences in 20-minute sessions. Reviewers review
  students’ work and offer tips to improve the chances of finding work within the computer graphics
  industry. Students are matched to industry professionals based on their desired work field and job skills
  and provide their resume and/or reel for review and expert advice. S3 provides four S3R3 sessions
  throughout the year during the Winter (virtual), Spring (virtual), Summer (at SIGGRAPH), and Fall (at
  SIGGRAPH Asia and virtual). Some example categories for students to choose from to have their
  work/resumes reviewed are not limited to but include the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Art/Animation (experience in modeling, texturing, compositing, animation, etc.)</li>
    <li>Production/Design (experience brainstorming ideas and transforming creative vision into reality)</li>
    <li>Technical Art (experience in hybrid/ equal parts programming and art: rigging, scripting, shader
      writing, etc.)</li>
    <li>Technical Development (experience in strictly technical aspects such as programming,
      rendering, robotics, engineering, etc.)</li>
    <li>Management (experience in producing, production assistant coordinating production and
      managerial aspects)</li>
</ul>
