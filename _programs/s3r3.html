<p>S3R3 is the S3 Resume and Reel Review program where industry professionals will sit down with you in 20-minute sessions to look over your work and offer tips to improve your chances finding work within the computer graphics industry. As such, S3R3 aims to remove some of the guesswork by providing professional advice and opinions to ACM SIGGRAPH student members. Students are matched to industry professionals based on their desired work field and job skills and provide the resume and/or reel for review and expert advice. S3R3 is offered on-site during both the SIGGRAPH and SIGGRAPH Asia conferences, as well as being offered virtually during the year. Some example categories for students to choose from to have their work/resumes reviewed are not limited to but include the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Art/Animation (experience in modeling, texturing, compositing, animation, etc.)</li>
    <li>Production/Design (experience brainstorming ideas and transforming creative vision into reality)</li>
    <li>Technical Art (experience in hybrid/ equal parts programming and art: rigging, scripting, shader writing, etc.)</li>
    <li>Technical Development (experience in strictly technical aspects such as programming, rendering, robotics, engineering, etc.)</li>
    <li>Management (experience in producing, production assistant coordinating production and managerial aspects</li>
</ul>
