  <p><em>Authors: Chenyang Hu, Darrell Bosch, and Wei Zhang</em></p><p>Pressure
  for reducing carbon emissions and increasing reliance on renewable fuels may
  give rise to higher and more variable energy prices in the future. Higher
  energy prices and potential higher demand for ethanol might have important
  implications for agriculture, an energy-intensive industry. Our study examines
  the possible implications for U.S. agriculture of increases in energy prices
  and demand for ethanol.<br><br>We find that higher energy prices lead to
  higher crop prices and lower crop output. Crop acres including corn decrease
  in most farm regions with the exception of Northern Plains. Livestock
  production tends to decline in response to higher energy costs. Total
  livestock value tends to increase reflecting that reduced output is more than
  offset by higher prices. The regional distribution of the value of livestock
  changes very little in response to energy price increases.<br><br>Higher
  ethanol demand for domestic use and for export leads to expansion of corn
  production but reduction of feed grain sorghum. Crop output increases the most
  in the Corn Belt which has the largest share of corn. Livestock production
  tends to increase in response to higher ethanol demand due to the increased
  availability of by-products used for animal feed. Total livestock value tends
  to decrease as price decreases offset the effects of increased
  output.<br><br>The vulnerability of agricultural enterprises to energy price
  increases varies by enterprise and region depending on their energy intensity
  and region where production occurs. Increases in demand for ethanol have
  important direct effects by expanding corn acreage, but also have indirect
  effects on the relative profitability and price of livestock enterprises
  through the availability and price of ethanol by-products. Farmers, farm
  advisors, lenders, input suppliers, and policymakers need to be aware of these
  effects and be well prepared to anticipate the effects of possible energy
  price increases and ethanol policy changes.</p>
