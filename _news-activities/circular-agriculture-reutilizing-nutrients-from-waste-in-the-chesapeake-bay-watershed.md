  <p><em>Author: Whitney Lisenbee</em></p><p>Circular systems have become a
  rising area of research in agriculture. The goal is to reduce and recycle
  waste streams for both environmental and economic benefits. In the
  agricultural regions of the Chesapeake Bay watershed, manure waste can be
  reutilized as a source of organic fertilizer for crops. Manure is currently
  constrained by transportation and storage limits but our study investigates
  what if manure could be transported further from the source? Is there enough
  cropland to utilize all the manure produced in the region?
  </p><p>Additionally, humans produce excess food waste that typically ends up
  in landfills where it produces significant greenhouse gas emissions. This
  waste could be composted to serve as another form of nutrients for cropland
  instead. We studied the production and application of food waste compost as an
  additional source of organic fertilizer along with manure.  </p><p>We found
  that current manure production is applied to 16% of cropland in the
  Susquehanna River Basin, the largest agricultural watershed draining to the
  Chesapeake Bay. However, almost half of that is applied at levels higher than
  recommended due to transportation constraints. With improved transportation,
  17% of cropland was able to apply manure at the recommended rate. Finally,
  food waste compost was able to double the amount of “circular” cropland by
  providing organic fertilizer to an additional 16% of cropland (for a total of
  33%), typically in areas where manure was not available. </p><p>Circular
  agricultural strategies such as these provide many benefits e.g., reduced
  emissions, improved soil health, and reduced nutrient imports. However, we
  found that increased circularity could have a negative effect on water quality
  due to higher nitrogen application rates with organic fertilizers. Therefore,
  to continue decreasing nutrients reaching the Chesapeake Bay,
  nutrient-reducing conservation practices and nutrient management plans must
  accompany these circular agricultural practices.</p>
