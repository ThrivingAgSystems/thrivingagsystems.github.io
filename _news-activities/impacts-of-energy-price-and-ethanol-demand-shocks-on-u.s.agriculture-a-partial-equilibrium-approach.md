description: '<p>A paper by Thriving Ag Project Task 13 team members, Chenyang Hu,
  Darrell Bosch, and Wei Zhang at Virginia Tech was accepted for presentation at the
  Southern Agricultural Economics Association Annual Meeting in February 2022. Cheyang
  Hu''s presentation at the SAEA Annual Meeting was titled, "Impacts of Energy Price
  and Ethanol Demand Shocks on U.S. Agriculture: A Partial Equilibrium Approach".
  A description of the presentation is provided below.</p><p>Agriculture is an energy-intensive
  industry while energy prices are likely to increase in the coming decade. We try
  to examine the implications of energy price and ethanol demand shocks for revenues,
  prices, and output from the U.S. agriculture sector. We examine the effects of energy
  price and ethanol demand shocks using the REAP (Regional Environment and Agriculture
  Programming) model, a partial equilibrium model implemented using nonlinear mathematical
  programming. Four scenarios are simulated in our research. Scenario 1 assumes a
  constant ethanol market while energy costs increased by 10%, 20%, and 30%, representatively.
  Scenario 2 assumes ethanol domestic consumption still faces the 10% ‘blend wall’
  but ethanol export doubles. Scenario 3 assumes ethanol domestic consumption faces
  the mid-level 20% ‘blend wall’ and ethanol export doubles. Scenario 4 assumes ethanol
  domestic consumption faces the mid-level 20% ‘blend wall’ and ethanol export quadruples.</p><p>The
  major results in Scenario 1 are: 1) higher energy prices lead to higher crop prices
  and lower crop output and lower livestock production; 2) crop acres decrease in
  most farm regions with the exception of Northern Plains and Lake States. The major
  results in Scenario 2, 3, and 4 are: 1) higher ethanol demand (both domestic and
  export) leads to expansion of corn production but reduction of minor feed grains
  production (sorghum, barley, and oats); 2) livestock production tends to increase
  in response to higher ethanol demand due to the increased availability of by-products
  used for animal feed; 3) crop output increases the most in Corn Belt which has large
  shares of corn.</p><p>You can <a href="https://thrivingag.org/research/economic-simulations-and-modelling/"
