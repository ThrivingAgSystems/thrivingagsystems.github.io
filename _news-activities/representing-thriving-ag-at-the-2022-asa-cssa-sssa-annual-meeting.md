  <p><em>Author: &nbsp;Madeline Luthard</em></p><p>In November of 2022, I had
  the opportunity to attend the ASA-CSSA-SSSA International Annual Meeting in
  Baltimore, MD. Between the three societies – the American Society of Agronomy
  (ASA), Crop Science Society of America (CSSA), and Soil Science Society of
  America (SSSA) – which are fondly referred to as the “Tri-Societies”, this
  conference brings together thousands of researchers and industry professionals
  each year. For 2022, the meeting’s emphasis was “Communication and Public
  Engagement for Healthy People and a Healthy Planet.”</p><p>As a student who
  began my graduate coursework in the fall of 2020 and experienced much of my
  first two years at Penn State in virtual classes and meetings, I was thrilled
  to attend my first in-person research conference this past fall. A group of
  graduate students, postdocs, and undergraduates from our lab group made the
  drive from State College, PA to Baltimore. Once we arrived, we filled our
  schedules with research talks and symposia, as well as professional
  development activities, creative outlets (including soil painting and an art
  contest), and networking opportunities.</p><p>I presented a poster and
  five-minute flash talk titled, “Investigating soil texture as a control on
  microbial carbon cycling.” In the poster and flask talk, I shared results from
  a project that is supported in part by the Thriving Ag Project as a component
  of ongoing work by Task Team 7 – Field Scale Nutrient Management Tools. I was
  honored that my poster was awarded 1st place in the graduate student
  competition for the Soil Biology and Biochemistry Division. Overall, my
  experience at the Tri-Societies meeting was incredibly enriching, and I was
  inspired to learn about more ongoing research that is complementary to and in
  alignment with the goals of the Thriving Ag Project. I look forward to future
  professional conference meetings and more opportunities to represent the
  Thriving Ag team!</p>
