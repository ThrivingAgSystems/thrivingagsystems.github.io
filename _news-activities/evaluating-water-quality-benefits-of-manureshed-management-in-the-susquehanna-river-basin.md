  manure is a valuable source of agricultural nutrients. However, manure source areas
  are often geographically disconnected from agricultural fields in need of fertilizer.
  The concept of the manureshed, which connects manure sources with agricultural fields
  in need of nutrients, is a helpful tool for managing manure distribution. A manureshed
  (analogous to a watershed) is the land area that receives manure from a specific
  source, when manure is applied at a rate that meets crop nitrogen or phosphorus
  needs. The manureshed approach allows for better nutrient budgeting on a regional
  scale, but its effects on stream water quality are not well understood. Excessive
  or untimely manure application can increase nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations
  in runoff from agricultural fields, which leads to downstream eutrophication. This
  type of nutrient pollution is of particular concern in estuaries such as the Chesapeake
  Bay watershed, which receives water from highly agricultural regions in the surrounding
  states. Our study uses the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to examine the
  water quality impacts of manureshed management in the Susquehanna River Basin, a
  major tributary of the Chesapeake Bay.</p><p>We devised a scenario-based modeling
  study to evaluate various manureshed management scenarios in the Susquehanna River
  Basin. We formulated six scenarios (including a baseline), involving variations
  in crop nitrogen and phosphorus demand, to compare the impacts of different manureshed
  management strategies. Simulation results showed improved manure nutrient use efficiency
  and significant water quality benefits with manureshed-based manure management,
  especially when manure application was based on crop phosphorus demand. A nutrient-balanced
  manureshed scenario, where manure was transported from source to sink areas, also
  reduced the agricultural nutrient contribution from the Susquehanna River Basin
  to the Chesapeake Bay. Impacts on local streams in livestock-intensive areas were
  even more pronounced. We conclude that manureshed management, in combination with
  existing nutrient management plans, can aid in protecting streams around concentrated
  animal feeding operations.</p><p>Original article: <a href="https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jeq2.20429"
