  mail survey asked about respondents’ levels of awareness of and views on water quality
  issues in local streams and waterways and the Chesapeake Bay in general. Questions
  also investigated agricultural producers' perceptions of causes of water quality
  issues, how to address water quality issues, and the future of agriculture in urbanized
  areas (including their knowledge and intention to continue using various Best Management
  Practices (BMPs)), their views and perceptions of Nutrient Management Plans, views
  on how agriculture can be sustainable in an urbanized landscape, their views and
  concerns about the loss of agricultural land, and attitudes about the urbanization
  of agriculture in the CBW including scenarios developed by the Thriving Agriculture
  research team (https:/thrivingag.org/) to ensure agriculture is economically viable
  and environmentally sustainable in the future. The response rate was 16.2%, with
  371 producers participating. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WF7tsiANcPLvQjmt6QLNh6I3Ki_lYOYs/view?usp=sharing"
