  <p><em>Author: Chiu-Lin Huang</em></p><p>Task 5 Team completed an experiment
  this August to assess consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for local foods
  across different urban-rural landscapes. To validate the results obtained from
  scanner data, the team designed a lab-in-the-field experiment. This experiment
  investigated how different interpretations of “local”—whether produced locally
  or predominantly sold locally—affect purchasing decisions among supermarket
  shoppers in urban and rural Pennsylvania. The experiment was conducted at two
  supermarkets owned by the Giant Company: a Giant supermarket in Huntingdon,
  PA, and a Martin’s supermarket in Altoona, PA. It aimed to elicit consumers’
  actual WTP for local and non-local potato chips. On average, consumers in
  rural area (Huntingdon) are willing to pay 10 percent more for local potato
  chips. In urban area (Altoona), however, while consumers are willing to pay
  slightly more for local potato chips than for non-local ones, this difference
  is not statistically significant. This finding aligns with earlier project
  results, which indicated that consumers in more rural or agricultural areas
  tend to have higher WTP values for local food. Importantly, the alternative
  definitions of “local”—one defined by the area of production and the other by
  the predominant area of sales—did not significantly impact WTP for local
  chips. While urban consumers in Altoona demonstrated a higher WTP for
  non-local potato chips, and rural consumers in Huntingdon showed a willingness
  to pay a premium for local chips, there was no significant difference in local
  premiums between urban and rural areas under either definition of “local.”</p>
