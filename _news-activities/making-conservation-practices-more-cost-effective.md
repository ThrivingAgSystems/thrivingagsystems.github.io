  <p>Numerous studies support improving the effectiveness of pollution control
  efforts by targeting them to areas with the most potential to reduce the
  pollutant(s) at the least cost. Targeting can involve the selection of
  practices to be supported as well as the types and locations of farms where
  practice subsidies will be awarded. For example, some farms in the Chesapeake
  Bay watershed have higher potential to deliver pollutant loadings to the Bay
  due to their proximity to the Bay. Subsidies to reduce loadings on such farms
  will be more cost effective compared to subsidies awarded to similar farms
  located further from the Bay which deliver proportionately less of their
  pollution to the Bay (Xu et al. 2020).</p><p>Targeting can also involve the
  selection of practices that achieve pollution reduction at lowest cost. For
  example, conservation practices on working land may be more cost effective
  than land retirement in reducing nutrient pollution. Working lands practices
  include reduced tillage, cover crops, nutrient management, and enhanced
  nutrient management, which involves subsidizing farmers to reduce nutrient
  applications below agronomic recommendations (Chesapeake Bay Commission,
  2004). Idling land may result in other land being brought into agricultural
  production. As a result, the effective amount of land retired is less than
  intended, a phenomenon called slippage. Slippage reduces the total amount of
  pollution reduction achieved by land retirement, which raises the cost of
  nutrient reduction. Hu et al. (2024) found for a given government budget
  expenditure, that enhanced nutrient management reduced nitrogen loadings by a
  greater amount than land
  retirement.</p><p><em>References:</em></p><p>Chesapeake Bay Commission. 2004.
