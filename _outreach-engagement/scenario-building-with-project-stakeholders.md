Following the envisioning exercise will be scenario-building exercises with the Board and project team. Scenarios will be used to explore alternative approaches to achieving the long-term TFP and NUE goals. Scenario storylines are designed to illuminate different visions of what the future could hold; they are not predictions. Well-constructed scenario storylines are creative, rigorous, internally coherent, and plausible (Rounsevell and Metzger, 2010). One scenario will be a business-as-usual scenario of how agriculture in urbanized areas of the U.S. may evolve over the next 25 years if current trends continue, as a basis against which other scenarios will be assessed. Other scenarios will be normative and participatory, framed around desired futures for agriculture in urbanized landscapes and shaped by the Board, while retaining scientific realism
