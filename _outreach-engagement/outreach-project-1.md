To achieve nutrient reduction targets and improve water quality, farmer incentive programs will need to reach beyond enthusiastic BMP adopters to communities with lower baseline environmental motivation. Reducing nutrient runoff is likely to require creating incentives for more farms to adopt revenue-enhancing or revenue-neutral practices and motivating farmers to adopt practices that provide nonmonetary benefits to themselves and communities (Wainger et al., 2013). Group incentive instruments are a promising approach to increasing levels of practice adoption (Kaczan et al., 2017; Poe et al., 2004; Segerson, 1988). Collective action is induced by generating reciprocal behavior among group members but can be undermined by free-riders (Sobel, 2005). Groups with pro-social members can induce self-interested members to make sacrifices to achieve a public good.

Wainger, Read, and Shortle are using farmer-stakeholder meetings to test aspects of institutional structures that are hypothesized to promote pro-social behavior and collective problem-solving. The primary hypothesis to test is: Are participants more motivated to act to reduce nutrients when they develop a threshold goal through group interaction or when one is imposed upon on them? They are testing whether the degree of motivation varies by the probability of legal liability being imposed on the group, if the threshold reduction is not achieved. They are recruiting diverse farmer participants and statistically test for differences between experimental and control groups.

They have been designing a collaborative field test with a group of technical assistance providers and are trying to figure out an intervention that they could test while they're out on the farm working. They are shifting to more of a photo visualization method where they are showing photos of different best management practices in order to see if that is more effective or not for getting individuals interested in adopting the practices.

They have begun thinking about a natural experiment that tests higher-level variables such as the presence or absence of a farmer mentoring program or just the influence of staff funding on best management practice implementation.
