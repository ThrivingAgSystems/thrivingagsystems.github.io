This research aims to generate an understanding of best practices to guide agri-environmental problem solving among agricultural producers, agents promoting environmental goals, and other stakeholders. This information will help inform field staff from USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), soil and water conservation districts, university extension, non-profits, and private consultants on how to effectively engage with farmers across the Chesapeake Bay region.
